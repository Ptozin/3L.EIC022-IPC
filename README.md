## Project Grade: 17.4/20

The project consisted of developing a mobile application that would help in any academic users at FEUP. The group decided to develop an application to integrate University of Porto canteens' menus and provide a way to rate the meals. The prototype was developed using Figma and you can access it [here](https://www.figma.com/proto/UXb9os2vZb5YHtPL3FjWGa/IPC-Mockups?node-id=207-4005&starting-point-node-id=207%3A4005&mode=design&t=i9kwNznGYbVtuHoJ-1).
